# terraform --quiet

The output of large terraform plans is super noisy.
This app intends to add some nice UX around it, to highlight the most relevant bits.

## Roadmap

- [x] Highlight unfiltered output
- [ ] Collapse resources with no changes (checkbox defaults to `on`)
- [ ] Hide lines with no changes (checkbox defaults to `on`)
- [ ] Publish as interactive app
